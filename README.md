# Upper tropospheric circulation associated with Kelvin waves propagating through the Madden-Julian oscillation

This repository contains all the code I used to finish my final research project for my Data Analysis course on Spring 2023 at UAlbany, SUNY. The repository contains the following

* Jupyter Notebooks containing my Python codes to get the upper troposphere composites of OLR, geopotential height, winds, temperature, and moisture for a Kelvin wave propagating through the active (RMM 3) and suppressed (RMM 7) convective phase of the MJO
* The netCDF files containing the daily gridded upper level OLR, geopotential height, winds, temperature, and moisture for 1979-1996 from NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis are too big to be uploaded here, but at available in their website.
* My final research paper
